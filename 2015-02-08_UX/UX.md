# Creating A Good User Experience 

- Looking sexy is not always enough. 
- Personality is a big deal, right?
- They need to know how to use it. 

## Why have a UX? 

What exactly does the customer see of an app? 

**Business logic? Databases?**

### Nope. 

In terms of MVC (Model-View-Controller), they only see the **View**. 

A manager I worked with at JPMC was looking to hire a UX Developer. It was only internal work. If the guy was "good", he was going to make $120.00 an hour (in Columbus). That's a shit ton of money. But every one had to answer a question...

>What is the most important part of a user interface? 

Yet nobody seemed to know.

The answer he was looking for was **The User**.

## The User

- Do they know how to use it
- Do the like how it looks
- Is is easy to learn
- To they need to be told *how* to use it?
- etc...

## Introductions and tutorials 

There is no need to tell the user how to use your app. It should be understood. If the design is good, then they can figure it out.
